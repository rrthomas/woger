Woger
=====

_Welease pwomptly, welease wegularly!_

Woger automatically makes releases and release announcements to GitHub, SourceForge, freshmeat, gnu.org and the Lua mailing list, and is easily extensible to other systems. It is easy to use it directly from a build system, and can prompt interactively for passwords and even release notes. It uses [copher](http://copher.sourceforge.net/) to talk to SourceForge, [Snake Steak](http://repo.cat-v.org/snake_steak/) to talk to FreshMeat, and `mail` to send email.

Woger is weleased under the GNU General Public License version 3, or (at your option) any later version.
