Woger
#####

_Welease pwomptly, welease wegularly!_

Woger automatically makes releases and release announcements to SourceForge, freshmeat, GNU and the Lua mailing list, and is easily extensible to other systems. It requires the user to supply only the SourceForge login credentials, a release notes file (which is prompted for if empty or non-existent) and a FreshMeat release focus. It is easy to use it directly from a build system. It uses [http://copher.sourceforge.net/|copher] to talk to SourceForge, [http://www.ivarch.com/programs/fm-submit.shtml|fm-submit] to talk to FreshMeat, and @mail@ to send email.

Woger is weleased under the GNU General Public License version 3, or (at your option) any later version.

Usage
=====

The command:

   @woger METHODS PACKAGE NAME VERSION DESCRIPTION NOTES@

releases version @VERSION@ of package @PACKAGE@, full name @NAME@, and short description @DESCRIPTION@, taking the release notes from the file @NOTES@, which you will be given the opportunity to edit. (For the editor to be invoked, you must set the environment variable @VISUAL@ to your preferred editor.)

Here's an automake target for release that I have used:

@release: distcheck@
	@cvs diff && \\@
        @cvs tag rel-`echo $(VERSION) | sed -e 's/\./-/g'` && \\@
        @woger sourceforge,freshmeat $(PACKAGE) "$(PACKAGE_NAME)" $(VERSION) "$(DESCRIPTION)" release-notes-$(VERSION)@

You may want to add the release notes file name to @.cvsignore@ or your VCS's equivalent.
