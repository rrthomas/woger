# Woger

_Welease pwomptly, welease wegularly!_

Woger makes releases and release announcements to GitHub, SourceForge,
gnu.org, luarocks.org and the Lua mailing list, and is easily extensible to
other systems. It is easy to use it directly from a build system, and can
prompt interactively for passwords and even release notes.

Woger is weleased under the GNU General Public License version 3, or (at
your option) any later version.
